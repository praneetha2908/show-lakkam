## Actors I Would Love to See in the Role
In this section, I’ve compiled a list of actors who I think could do an excellent job playing the main role in *Sita Ramam*, besides the original actor Dulquer Salmaan. These actors were chosen based on their ability to bring depth to the character and their versatility. Here’s a list of suggestions:

| Actor Name             | Reason for Picking Them                                            | Age (as of 2025) |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Amitabh Bachchan       | Known for his powerful acting and ability to portray emotional depth. | 82               |
| Prabhas                | A versatile actor with a strong screen presence.                    | 45               |
| Nani                   | Great at portraying a mix of humor and seriousness, ideal for a nuanced character. | 40               |
| Hrithik Roshan         | Has the charm and intensity to play a complex character.            | 50               |

## Code Fencing Example
This code snippet demonstrates the creation of a basic JavaScript **Promise**. The Promise constructor takes an executor function with two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`. The asynchronous operation takes place inside the executor function, where we either resolve the promise on success or reject it with a failure reason.
```javascript
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // asynchronous operation

  // then in case of success
  resolve();
  // or
  reject("failure reason");
});
